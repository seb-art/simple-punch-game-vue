# Simple Punch Game in Vue

A fun, interactive game built with Vue.js where players can "punch" a bag to reduce its health until it "bursts." Each punch plays a sound effect and triggers an animation, making the game engaging and enjoyable.

## Demo

## Features

- **Punch the Bag**: Press the "Punch" button to reduce the bag's health by 10 points. Each punch plays a sound effect and animates the bag, giving a realistic feel.
- **Health Bar**: Displays the bag's current health percentage. When health reaches 0%, the bag "bursts."
- **Restart Game**: Reset the game at any time to bring the bag back to full health.
- **Punch Animation**: The bag moves away from the screen slightly with each punch for a 3D effect.
- **Punch Sound**: Plays a punch sound effect with every punch.

## Project Structure

- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the game interface.
- **CSS**: Adds styles and animations for bag movement and bursting effects.
- **JavaScript (Vue.js)**: Manages the game's functionality, handling punch and restart actions and updating the UI.

## Technologies Used
